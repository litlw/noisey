this is a game for people to play.

The game is stopped in development for these reasons:


Inside Presentation:

- Unable to get song list as a usable array
  - calling array on its own lists as [{..}, {..}, ...]
  - calling array with string console.log("this array is " + array.toString()) returns nothing.
  - Array cannot be passed to pubnub

This is an integral part of the game, and for now because of this the game is on hold.

Working features:
- getting songs from freesound API w/ Oauth
- getting MP3 URLs from freesound API w/ Oauth
- registering users
- registering which users are players, and which user is the leader
- registering topic question
- registering random avatar for user.


Maybe I'll develop on this further. sorry it doesnt work as is.
